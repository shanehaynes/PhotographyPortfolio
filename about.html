        <h3>My Story</h3>
        <p>I'm Shane Haynes, an outdoor photographer and adventurer based in the American West. My passion for photography began during my first backpacking trip through the Sierra Nevada, where I realized that some moments in nature are too beautiful not to share.</p>
        
        <p>What started as a way to document my adventures has evolved into a deep appreciation for the intersection of light, landscape, and human experience in the wilderness. I believe that photography has the power to inspire conservation and connect people to the natural world.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="about-section">
        <h3>My Approach</h3>
        <p>I specialize in capturing authentic moments in the outdoors - from the golden hour light hitting mountain peaks to the quiet intimacy of a climber on a challenging route. My work spans landscape photography, adventure sports, and environmental portraiture.</p>
        
        <p>Whether I'm documenting a multi-day climbing expedition or capturing the delicate beauty of alpine wildflowers, I strive to tell the complete story of our relationship with wild places.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="about-section">
        <h3>Adventure & Conservation</h3>
        <p>When I'm not behind the camera, you'll find me climbing, skiing, or exploring the backcountry. These experiences inform my photography and drive my commitment to environmental conservation.</p>
        
        <p>I believe that sharing the beauty of wild places through photography can inspire others to protect them. Through my work, I hope to foster a deeper connection between people and the natural world.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="about-section">
        <h3>Let's Connect</h3>
        <p>I'm always interested in new adventures and collaborative projects. Whether you're planning an expedition, need photography for a conservation initiative, or just want to share stories about the outdoors, I'd love to hear from you.</p>
        
        <p>Follow my adventures and see more of my work as I continue to explore the wild places that inspire us all.</p>
